```

Column {data-width=650}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart A

```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  #mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price, text = ~text_label,
    alpha = .5, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```

Column {data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart B

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    y = ~price, x = ~neighbourhood, color = ~neighbourhood,
    type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

### Chart C

Let's look at the zipcodes with the most violations in Manhattan, and see how many violations they have in the dataset.

Ok, this is kind of boring, but it's a thing you can do...

```{r}
rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(boro == "MANHATTAN") %>% 
  count(zipcode) %>%
  mutate(zipcode = as.factor(zipcode),
         zipcode = fct_reorder(zipcode, -n)) %>% 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n)) < 11) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~zipcode, y = ~n, 
    type = "bar")
```
